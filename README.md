# Brownfield Of Dreams

Project Spec and Evaluation Rubric: https://github.com/turingschool-examples/brownfield-of-dreams

**Learning Goals and Labels**

Learning goals for this project focused on lessening technical debt in an existing project. At inception the project has many objects which serve no purpose, testing coverage is less than 30%, and over 1200 exceptions thrown by the linting tool RuboCop. 

### About the Project

This is a Ruby on Rails application used to organize YouTube content used for online learning. Each tutorial is a playlist of video segments. Within the application an admin is able to create tags for each tutorial in the database. A visitor or registered user can then filter tutorials based on these tags.

A visitor is able to see all of the content on the application but in order to bookmark a segment they will need to register. Once registered a user can bookmark any of the segments in a tutorial page.

## Local Setup

First you'll need to setup an API key with YouTube and have it defined within `ENV['YOUTUBE_API_KEY']`. There will be one failing spec if you don't have this set up.
